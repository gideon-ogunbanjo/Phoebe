This is a Machine Learning Model that predicts the returns on stocks using the LSTM neural Network.
I also built a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.
To build the stock price prediction model, i used the NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset. This is a dataset of Tata Beverages from Tata Global Beverages Limited, National Stock Exchange of India.
To develop the dashboard for stock analysis i used another stock dataset with multiple stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook.
All my datasets are found in my repository.
